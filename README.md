# majick - turn-based combat game

## Description

“majick” is a simple text-based/CLI-based turn-based combat game. The goal of the game is to fight as many enemies as you can to get the highest score (based on how many health points the defeated enemy has).

You play as a character with three basic stats: health points (HP), attack (ATK), and defense (DEF). The main mechanic of the game is fighting enemies in turn-based combat, where you and the enemy take turns hitting each other. The damage both you and the enemy deal is based on a randomized die roll; the total amount of damage dealt is simply ATK * die roll outcome. Combat can either end in a failure, where the enemy kills you (you fall below 0 HP) and the game is over, or success, where you kill the enemy and gain points based on its HP. A possible stretch is having a level-up system based on cumulative points gained from defeating enemies — if you reach a certain amount of points, you level up, and your stats are boosted.
